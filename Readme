# Apex Inventory System

A premium inventory management and Point of Sale (POS) application built with the MERN stack.It features real-time telemetry, role-based access control, and secure cryptographic authentication.

## 🌟 Core Features

* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Strict separation of concerns between `Admin` (full access, user provisioning, financial reports, dashboard valuations) and `Staff` (read-only inventory, POS operations).
* **Enterprise Point of Sale (POS):** Multi-item shopping cart system with automatic, transactional stock deduction and backend validation to prevent overselling.
* **Real-Time Telemetry Dashboard:** Aggregated data visualization using Recharts, including:
  * 7-day revenue trajectories (Area charts)
  * Asset allocation by category (Doughnut charts)
  * Inventory health and low-stock alerts (Bar charts)
* **Cryptographic Security:** JWT-based session management, bcrypt password hashing, and secure token-based password reset flows using Node's native `crypto` module.
* **Premium User Interface:** Responsive, fixed-sidebar architecture utilizing CSS variables for a cohesive "Corporate Trust" light theme. Fully icon-driven using `lucide-react`.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally for development.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/apex-inventory-system.git](https://github.com/yourusername/apex-inventory-system.git)
cd apex-inventory-system

2. Environment Variables
Create a .env file in your backend directory and configure the following variables:

PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key

3. Install Dependencies
You will need to install the dependencies for both the backend and the frontend separately.

Backend:
Bash
cd backend
npm install

Frontend:
Bash
cd ../client
npm install
4. Run the Application
Open two terminal windows to run the servers concurrently.

Terminal 1 (Backend Server):
Bash
cd backend
npm run start

Terminal 2 (Frontend Client):
Bash
cd client
npm run dev
The frontend will typically be available at http://localhost:5173 and the backend at http://localhost:5000.

🔒 Security Architecture
API Protection: All critical backend routes are protected by the protect middleware. Financial operations, user management, and reporting routes require explicit validation via the isAdmin middleware.

Data Sanitization: Passwords are never sent back to the client. The backend specifically filters out password fields when returning user lists.

State Synchronization: The frontend securely stores the JWT token in localStorage and attaches it as a Bearer token to all Axios requests via an interceptor.

Atomic Transactions: Bulk sales in the POS loop through stock checks before deduction to ensure data integrity during concurrent checkouts.
